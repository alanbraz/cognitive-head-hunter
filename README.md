# Cognitive Head Hunter - GBS Watson Challenge Application

  Cognitive Head Hunter is a cognitive based system to designed to help both a candidate and a HR professional make a good match more quickly and more reliably using Watson to read and extract cognitive information from the both the candidates providing a better match between them, not only by analyzing keywords but also by understanding the concepts outlined within a resume or a job posting.

## Watson Services used

  Concept Insights - The Concept Insights service links documents that you provide with a pre-existing graph of concepts based on Wikipedia (e.g. 'Cognitive Systems', 'Solar Energy', etc.). Users of this service can also search for documents that are relevant to a concept or collection of concepts by exploring concepts that are explicitly contained in your queries or are implicitly referenced through related concepts. [More about this service here][concept-insights].

  Personality Insights - The Watson Personality Insights service uses linguistic analytics to extract a spectrum of cognitive and social characteristics from the text data that a person generates through blogs, tweets, forum posts, and more. [More about this service here][personality-insights].

# Installation instructions

Click on the buttom bellow to deploy your own copy of Cognitive Head Hunter into your Bluemix account.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)][deploy-to-Bluemix]

And that's about it! You successfully just created a `Node.js` application in Bluemix together with a `Concept Insights`, `Personality Insights` and `Cloudant NoSQL DB` services required to this project.

Now it's time to configure your project.

# Manual installation

1. Fork or clone this repository.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to your cloned/forked project in your system.

3. Push your application to Bluemix using no manifest file. Type `cf push <application-name> --no-manifest` in your terminal.

4. Go to your Bluemix app which you just created in your Bluemix account.

5. Include a [Concept Insights][concept-insights] service in your application.

6. Include a [Personality Insights][personality-insights] service in your application.

7. Include a [Cloudant NoSQL DB][cloudant] service in your application. No database or view need to be created now, it will be done by the app on start-up.

8. Create two `USER_DEFINED` Environment Variables in your bluemix app named `LINKEDIN_APPKEY` and `LINKEDIN_APPSECRET`, initially with no values. (Continue reading to know how to create one)

9. Restart your application.

Now you just need to configure your project, follow the instructions bellow.

## Configuration instructions

This application uses [LinkedIn][linkedin] integration so you will have to create an application on it as part of the steps below.

1. Create a new [LinkedIn][linkedin] application to obtain keys needed in our integration. [You can create it here][linkedin_app]

2. Go to your application page at Bluemix and update the value of the two `USER_DEFINED` under Environment Variables.

3. Restart your application.

4. Go to `<application-name>.mybluemix.net` to see your own copy up and running!
